 DaVinci Resolve for noobs. If you'd like to have the entire audio from a video that you've made turned into a text file that you can use for something like a blog post, in DaVinci Resolve, go up to the finished audio of the project that you're working on, select it in the media pool, and then choose transcribe audio. Click on that and it'll give you a complete transcription including punctuation that will follow along with your entire video. In the upper right of that pop-up window, click on export and then you can save that file wherever you'd like.
