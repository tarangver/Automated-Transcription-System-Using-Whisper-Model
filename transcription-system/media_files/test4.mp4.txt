 This is a demonstration of using Pictree to transcribe a video into text. I'm going to use a Zoom recording I did earlier. As an example, I drag the Zoom file into Pictree and upload it. Pictree is now transcribing the video into text. You can see that Pictree has now transcribed the video into text. I can either edit the text here if I wish, or download it directly into a text file, using the button over here. You see it's that easy to transcribe videos to text. With the power of AI, and the best part is it only takes a minute. And here is the completed transcription, it is that easy to transcribe your videos into text. There is a free trial available, and if you like a 20% discount for lifetime, I have added a link in the comment. Do check that out. Thanks for watching. Have a great day.
